In this Branch we will see three different type of dependency Injection 

1) Property Injection
2) Setter Injection
3) Constructor Injection (Preferred)

First we Create them as Inject them manually and test them with Junit test

Second we will check  DI with Autowired 

If we have more then one Service Implementations which one spring will inject?


To solve this problem we can use Qualifier annotation and give then name.
we can also mark the service with primary annotation so if we don't specify which service it takes automatically service marked with primary will assign there
